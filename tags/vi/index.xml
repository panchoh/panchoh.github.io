Having the minimal vi around always felt good, because I could leverage its awesome power (packed in but a couple hundred kilobytes) and snappy startup time to do some edits here and there.
But, alas, it is not available on nixpkgs, and I had not found the time to build it from scratch myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
