export HISTCONTROL=$HISTCONTROL${HISTCONTROL+,}ignoredups I found interesting the ${HISTCONTROL+,} construct, which will evaluate to a comma (,) if HISTCONTROL is defined, to the empty string otherwise (I checked).

cd $OLDPWD This is a bit cumbersome to type, so this shortcut is provided:
cd - (My then-classmate Carlos told me about this back in ’98).
