Recently, python 3.8 entered the arch repos, replacing python 3.7 altogether. Note that python 2.7 is still available, although I expect that it will be dropped on January.
So, if you are working on a project that depends on python 3.7, you can leverage pyenv, which is readily available from the Community repo.</description></item></channel></rss>
