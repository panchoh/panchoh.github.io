Sometimes (e.g., TED.com) the site kindly provides you with a link to download the video stream, but more often than not, they don’t (e.g., YouTube).
There are some tools around which will download the video feed for you, but only work for certain well-known sites. I’m thinking of course of clive and youtube-dl. These tools work by reverse-engineering the protocol the Flash client uses to talk to the &amp;ldquo;mothership&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
